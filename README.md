## üîÅ High-Level Architecture

![Alt text](./data/architecture.png)

### üüß **1. Feature Extraction Pipeline**

**Purpose:**
Transform raw Bible data into a structured, machine-friendly format.

#### Steps:

* **Load Raw KJV TSV File:**

  * Reads the King James Bible (`kjv.tsv`), which contains references and text for each verse.

* **Parse Book, Chapter & Verse:**

  * Splits each verse‚Äôs ‚ÄúReference‚Äù (e.g., ‚ÄúJohn 3:16‚Äù) into `Book`, `Chapter`, `Verse`.
  * Handles special book names and edge cases.

* **Export Cleaned Data:**

  * Produces a well-structured CSV (`kjv_preprocessed.csv`) ready for downstream semantic chunking and embedding.

---

### üü¶ **2. Ingest Pipeline**

**Purpose:**
Convert cleaned verse data into semantic, vectorized chunks for efficient retrieval.

#### Steps:

* **Chunk Verses:**

  * Groups adjacent verses (e.g., 8 at a time), within token and thematic constraints, to form meaningful passages for search.

* **Embedding for Chunked Verses:**

  * Uses the **OpenAI embedding model** (`text-embedding-3-small`) to generate dense vector embeddings for each passage.

* **Qdrant Ingestion:**

  * Embeds and metadata are indexed in a **Qdrant** vector database.
  * Supports fast similarity search (HNSW or other algorithms).

---

### üü• **3. RAG Pipeline (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**

**Purpose:**
Answer complex, nuanced user questions about the Bible using multi-agent reasoning and retrieval.

#### Steps:

* **User‚Äôs Question:**

  * The user asks an open-ended, possibly multi-part question.

* **RAG Chain (Decompose):**

  * An **LLM agent** (using `gpt-4.1-mini`) breaks the question into simpler sub-questions for more targeted retrieval.

* **Embedding-based Retrieval:**

  * For each sub-question, similar semantic chunks are fetched from Qdrant using vector similarity.

* **LLM-based Semantic Reranker (Cohere):**

  * The set of retrieved passages is **reranked** using **Cohere‚Äôs LLM-based reranker** for higher precision and better alignment with the query intent.
  * Ensures the most relevant contexts are passed to the summarizer.

* **Summarize:**

  * Another LLM agent (again `gpt-4.1-mini`) combines the most relevant passages, using chain-of-thought prompting, to produce a coherent, markdown-formatted answer.
  * Output includes theme grouping, book-level summaries, and possibly citations.

* **Final Answer:**

  * Returned to the user in rich markdown for clarity (e.g., bold, links).

---

### üü® **4. Evaluation Pipeline using RAGAS**

**Purpose:**
Objectively measure the quality and reliability of the RAG pipeline outputs.

#### Steps:

* **Generate Golden Testset:**

  * Use LLMs to create a reference set of gold questions and answers, grounded in Bible content.

* **RAGAS Evaluation:**

  * Run the full RAG pipeline on these test queries.
  * Compute **RAGAS metrics**:

    * `context_recall`: Did the model retrieve the right passages?
    * `faithfulness`: Are answers grounded in context?
    * `factual_correctness`, `entity_recall`, `noise_sensitivity`: Further fine-grained measures.

* **Review Metrics:**

  * Scores are tabulated and visualized (e.g., bar charts).
  * Used to compare **baseline vs. fine-tuned** embedding models, track improvements, and guide further tuning.

---

### üîë **Key Architecture Advantages**

* **Semantic & Agentic:**
  Each query is decomposed and answered using a blend of retrieval and reasoning, not just keyword search.

* **Composable Agents:**
  Modular pipeline: decompose ‚Üí retrieve ‚Üí rerank ‚Üí summarize.
  Each agent can be tuned or swapped independently.

* **LLM and Embedding Agnostic:**
  Easily swap OpenAI models, Qdrant for Pinecone/FAISS, or Cohere for other rerankers.

* **Rich Evaluation Loop:**
  Built-in, standards-based QA ensures that improvements (or regressions) are measurable and actionable.

* **Markdown & Hyperlinks:**
  Outputs are user-friendly and citeable for teaching, research, or study group settings.

* **Bible Study Leaders / Theologians / Educators:**

  * Get multi-faceted, cross-book answers to deep questions.
  * Save time vs. manual study.
  * Trust in faithfulness and grounding via strong evaluation metrics.

* **Conclusion:**

  * Highly modular, extensible stack (LangGraph, Qdrant, OpenAI, Cohere, RAGAS).
  * Easily test new retrieval, reranking, or evaluation strategies.

## üìå **Insights: RAGAS Metrics Interpretation**

### üîº Improved Metrics

- **context_recall (+4.84%)**
  - The fine-tuned model retrieves more relevant passages with higher consistency.
  - This suggests improved alignment between embeddings and document content.

- **context_entity_recall (+25.00%)**
  - Fine-tuning helped the model focus better on key biblical entities (e.g., people, books, places).
  - This is valuable for question answering tasks grounded in specific theological references.

- **noise_sensitivity (mode=relevant) (-57.89%)**
  - A significant reduction in retrieving irrelevant or distracting content.
  - Indicates better semantic discrimination by the fine-tuned model.

---

### ‚öñÔ∏è Stable Metric

- **answer_relevancy (-1.79%)**
  - Slight drop, but within tolerance. The answers remain mostly aligned with the user's question.
  - Suggests that despite changes in retrieval, coherence in responses is preserved.

---

### üîΩ Regressed Metrics

- **faithfulness (-5.88%)**
  - Minor decrease in how well answers adhere to source material.
  - May indicate increased abstraction or paraphrasing behavior in the generation phase.

- **factual_correctness (mode=F1) (-48.44%)**
  - Major decline in factual accuracy.
  - Signals the need for enhanced control mechanisms (e.g., factuality re-rankers or answer verification) during generation.

---

## üìà **Recommended Next Steps**

1. **Improve Factual Correctness:**

   * Use RAGAS-generated hallucination examples to fine-tune the model on factual answering.
   * Add NLI (Natural Language Inference) or factual reranking stages post-generation.

2. **Boost Faithfulness:**

   * Modify prompt instructions to enforce answer grounding.
   * Add more "chain-of-thought + evidence alignment" examples during fine-tuning.

3. **RAG Optimization:**

   * Consider reranking retrieved chunks or increasing `k` for retrieval.
   * Use sentence-level retrieval or chunk-fusion if entity recall is crucial.

4. **Instrumentation:**

   * Integrate [RAGAS feedback loop](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas) for continuous evaluation & regression tracking.
