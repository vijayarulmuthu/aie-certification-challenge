    "\n",
    "The target user is a Bible Study Leader, Theology Student, or Christian Educator who regularly engages with Scripture for research, teaching, or sermon preparation.\n",
    "\n",
    "These users often ask nuanced or multi-faceted questions such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ \"Where does the Bible talk about forgiveness across the Old and New Testaments?\"\n",
    "+ \"Which verses describe God’s mercy using similar language?\"\n",
    "+ \"Can you compare how love is portrayed in Psalms vs. in Paul's letters?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, they rely on keyword-based search or manual reading, which:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Fails to capture semantic meaning or cross-book relationships\n",
    "+ Is time-consuming, especially when preparing thematic studies\n",
    "+ Lacks a structured, intelligent interface for exploration or summarization\n",
    "\n",
    "By automating semantic search, cross-referencing, and thematic summarization, we can drastically improve how these users interact with Scripture — making Bible study more efficient, insightful, and personalized."

    "\n",
    "1. **Faithfulness ↑ (Improved)**\n",
    "   Fine-tuning significantly improved the model's faithfulness — it better grounds its answers in the retrieved content, which is a critical improvement for factual QA over biblical text.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Factual Correctness ↓ (Weaker)**\n",
    "   The drop in factual correctness may indicate overfitting or broader generalizations made by the fine-tuned model. A review of the LLM output or tuning strategy is advised.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Noise Sensitivity ↓ (Significantly Improved)**\n",
    "   The fine-tuned model is much more resilient to irrelevant context. This is particularly beneficial in long or multi-turn QA scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Context Recall ↓ (Slight Tradeoff)**\n",
    "   The model retrieves slightly less context overall, possibly due to tighter embeddings or more targeted chunks being matched.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Answer Relevancy ↔ (Stable)**\n",
    "   Both models produce similarly relevant answers to the input questions, reflecting solid LLM prompting and retrieval strategies in both cases.\n",

    "* The **fine-tuned embedding model** offers:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Improved grounding and faithfulness** of answers.\n",
    "  * **Much better resistance to noise**.\n",
    "  * A tradeoff in **factual precision**, which could be addressed with better reward signals or curated tuning data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 Recommendations to Improve **Factual Correctness**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Improve Training Data Quality**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Ensure that fine-tuning data contains rich, multi-hop and factually grounded answers.\n",
    "   * Incorporate counterfactual or adversarial examples to reduce hallucination.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Use Retrieval-Augmented Fine-Tuning**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Instead of just QA pairs, fine-tune using context-aware triples: `(context, question, answer)` to help the model stay grounded.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Apply Chain-of-Thought Prompting**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Include stepwise reasoning traces in training targets to improve factual generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Model Calibration**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Explore model confidence tuning or add reward models based on RAGAS factual correctness scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Hybrid RAG + Finetuning**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Use RAG to inject grounding context dynamically during inference, even post fine-tuning, to preserve factual correctness."
