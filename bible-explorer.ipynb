    "\n",
    "The target user is a Bible Study Leader, Theology Student, or Christian Educator who regularly engages with Scripture for research, teaching, or sermon preparation.\n",
    "\n",
    "These users often ask nuanced or multi-faceted questions such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ \"Where does the Bible talk about forgiveness across the Old and New Testaments?\"\n",
    "+ \"Which verses describe God’s mercy using similar language?\"\n",
    "+ \"Can you compare how love is portrayed in Psalms vs. in Paul's letters?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, they rely on keyword-based search or manual reading, which:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Fails to capture semantic meaning or cross-book relationships\n",
    "+ Is time-consuming, especially when preparing thematic studies\n",
    "+ Lacks a structured, intelligent interface for exploration or summarization\n",
    "\n",
    "By automating semantic search, cross-referencing, and thematic summarization, we can drastically improve how these users interact with Scripture — making Bible study more efficient, insightful, and personalized."

    "\n",
    "- **context_recall (+4.84%)**\n",
    "  - The fine-tuned model retrieves more relevant passages with higher consistency.\n",
    "  - This suggests improved alignment between embeddings and document content.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **context_entity_recall (+25.00%)**\n",
    "  - Fine-tuning helped the model focus better on key biblical entities (e.g., people, books, places).\n",
    "  - This is valuable for question answering tasks grounded in specific theological references.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **noise_sensitivity (mode=relevant) (-57.89%)**\n",
    "  - A significant reduction in retrieving irrelevant or distracting content.\n",
    "  - Indicates better semantic discrimination by the fine-tuned model.\n",

    "\n",
    "### ⚖️ Stable Metric\n",
    "\n",
    "- **answer_relevancy (-1.79%)**\n",
    "  - Slight drop, but within tolerance. The answers remain mostly aligned with the user's question.\n",
    "  - Suggests that despite changes in retrieval, coherence in responses is preserved.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 🔽 Regressed Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "- **faithfulness (-5.88%)**\n",
    "  - Minor decrease in how well answers adhere to source material.\n",
    "  - May indicate increased abstraction or paraphrasing behavior in the generation phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **factual_correctness (mode=F1) (-48.44%)**\n",
    "  - Major decline in factual accuracy.\n",
    "  - Signals the need for enhanced control mechanisms (e.g., factuality re-rankers or answer verification) during generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📈 **Recommended Next Steps**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Improve Factual Correctness:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Use RAGAS-generated hallucination examples to fine-tune the model on factual answering.\n",
    "   * Add NLI (Natural Language Inference) or factual reranking stages post-generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Boost Faithfulness:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Modify prompt instructions to enforce answer grounding.\n",
    "   * Add more \"chain-of-thought + evidence alignment\" examples during fine-tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **RAG Optimization:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Consider reranking retrieved chunks or increasing `k` for retrieval.\n",
    "   * Use sentence-level retrieval or chunk-fusion if entity recall is crucial.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Instrumentation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Integrate [RAGAS feedback loop](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas) for continuous evaluation & regression tracking.\n"
