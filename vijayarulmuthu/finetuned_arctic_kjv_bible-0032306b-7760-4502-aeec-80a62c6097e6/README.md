- source_sentence: What shall the priest do with the blood of the sin offering?
  sentences:
  - 'And the sons of Jeconiah; Assir, Salathiel his son, Malchiram also, and Pedaiah,
    and Shenazar, Jecamiah, Hoshama, and Nedabiah. And the sons of Pedaiah [were],
    Zerubbabel, and Shimei: and the sons of Zerubbabel; Meshullam, and Hananiah, and
    Shelomith their sister: And Hashubah, and Ohel, and Berechiah, and Hasadiah, Jushabhesed,
    five. And the sons of Hananiah; Pelatiah, and Jesaiah: the sons of Rephaiah, the
    sons of Arnan, the sons of Obadiah, the sons of Shechaniah. And the sons of Shechaniah;
    Shemaiah: and the sons of Shemaiah; Hattush, and Igeal, and Bariah, and Neariah,
    and Shaphat, six. And the sons of Neariah; Elioenai, and Hezekiah, and Azrikam,
    three. And the sons of Elioenai [were], Hodaiah, and Eliashib, and Pelaiah, and
    Akkub, and Johanan, and Dalaiah, and Anani, seven.'
  - 'And it came to pass, when Solomon had finished the building of the house of the
    LORD, and the king’s house, and all Solomon’s desire which he was pleased to do,
    That the LORD appeared to Solomon the second time, as he had appeared unto him
    at Gibeon. And the LORD said unto him, I have heard thy prayer and thy supplication,
    that thou hast made before me: I have hallowed this house, which thou hast built,
    to put my name there for ever; and mine eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually.
    And if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy father walked, in integrity of heart,
    and in uprightness, to do according to all that I have commanded thee, [and] wilt
    keep my statutes and my judgments: Then I will establish the throne of thy kingdom
    upon Israel for ever, as I promised to David thy father, saying, There shall not
    fail thee a man upon the throne of Israel. [But] if ye shall at all turn from
    following me, ye or your children, and will not keep my commandments [and] my
    statutes which I have set before you, but go and serve other gods, and worship
    them: Then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have given them; and
    this house, which I have hallowed for my name, will I cast out of my sight; and
    Israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all people: And at this house, [which]
    is high, every one that passeth by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss; and
    they shall say, Why hath the LORD done thus unto this land, and to this house?'
  - 'And he shall sprinkle of the blood of the sin offering upon the side of the altar;
    and the rest of the blood shall be wrung out at the bottom of the altar: it [is]
    a sin offering. And he shall offer the second [for] a burnt offering, according
    to the manner: and the priest shall make an atonement for him for his sin which
    he hath sinned, and it shall be forgiven him. But if he be not able to bring two
    turtledoves, or two young pigeons, then he that sinned shall bring for his offering
    the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a sin offering; he shall put no oil
    upon it, neither shall he put [any] frankincense thereon: for it [is] a sin offering.
    Then shall he bring it to the priest, and the priest shall take his handful of
    it, [even] a memorial thereof, and burn [it] on the altar, according to the offerings
    made by fire unto the LORD: it [is] a sin offering. And the priest shall make
    an atonement for him as touching his sin that he hath sinned in one of these,
    and it shall be forgiven him: and [the remnant] shall be the priest’s, as a meat
    offering. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, If a soul commit a trespass,
    and sin through ignorance, in the holy things of the LORD; then he shall bring
    for his trespass unto the LORD a ram without blemish out of the flocks, with thy
    estimation by shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary, for a trespass
    offering: And he shall make amends for the harm that he hath done in the holy
    thing, and shall add the fifth part thereto, and give it unto the priest: and
    the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram of the trespass offering,
    and it shall be forgiven him.'
- source_sentence: What accusations did Tertullus make against Paul?
  sentences:
  - But he went in, and stood before his master. And Elisha said unto him, Whence
    [comest thou], Gehazi? And he said, Thy servant went no whither. And he said unto
    him, Went not mine heart [with thee], when the man turned again from his chariot
    to meet thee? [Is it] a time to receive money, and to receive garments, and oliveyards,
    and vineyards, and sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and maidservants? The leprosy
    therefore of Naaman shall cleave unto thee, and unto thy seed for ever. And he
    went out from his presence a leper [as white] as snow.
  - 'After these things Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corinth; And found
    a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife
    Priscilla; (because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome:)
    and came unto them. And because he was of the same craft, he abode with them,
    and wrought: for by their occupation they were tentmakers. And he reasoned in
    the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks. And when Silas
    and Timotheus were come from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in the spirit, and testified
    to the Jews [that] Jesus [was] Christ. And when they opposed themselves, and blasphemed,
    he shook [his] raiment, and said unto them, Your blood [be] upon your own heads;
    I [am] clean: from henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles. And he departed thence,
    and entered into a certain [man’s] house, named Justus, [one] that worshipped
    God, whose house joined hard to the synagogue. And Crispus, the chief ruler of
    the synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians
    hearing believed, and were baptized.'
  - 'And after five days Ananias the high priest descended with the elders, and [with]
    a certain orator [named] Tertullus, who informed the governor against Paul. And
    when he was called forth, Tertullus began to accuse [him], saying, Seeing that
    by thee we enjoy great quietness, and that very worthy deeds are done unto this
    nation by thy providence, We accept [it] always, and in all places, most noble
    Felix, with all thankfulness. Notwithstanding, that I be not further tedious unto
    thee, I pray thee that thou wouldest hear us of thy clemency a few words. For
    we have found this man [a] pestilent [fellow], and a mover of sedition among all
    the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes:
    Who also hath gone about to profane the temple: whom we took, and would have judged
    according to our law. But the chief captain Lysias came [upon us], and with great
    violence took [him] away out of our hands, Commanding his accusers to come unto
    thee: by examining of whom thyself mayest take knowledge of all these things,
    whereof we accuse him.'
- source_sentence: What does he that ministereth seed to the sower also minister?
  sentences:
  - 'And the king commanded, and they brought great stones, costly stones, [and] hewed
    stones, to lay the foundation of the house. And Solomon’s builders and Hiram’s
    builders did hew [them], and the stonesquarers: so they prepared timber and stones
    to build the house.'
  - '(As it is written, He hath dispersed abroad; he hath given to the poor: his righteousness
    remaineth for ever. Now he that ministereth seed to the sower both minister bread
    for [your] food, and multiply your seed sown, and increase the fruits of your
    righteousness;) Being enriched in every thing to all bountifulness, which causeth
    through us thanksgiving to God. For the administration of this service not only
    supplieth the want of the saints, but is abundant also by many thanksgivings unto
    God; Whiles by the experiment of this ministration they glorify God for your professed
    subjection unto the gospel of Christ, and for [your] liberal distribution unto
    them, and unto all [men]; And by their prayer for you, which long after you for
    the exceeding grace of God in you. Thanks [be] unto God for his unspeakable gift.'
  - 'Then Israel sent messengers unto the king of Edom, saying, Let me, I pray thee,
    pass through thy land: but the king of Edom would not hearken [thereto]. And in
    like manner they sent unto the king of Moab: but he would not [consent]: and Israel
    abode in Kadesh. Then they went along through the wilderness, and compassed the
    land of Edom, and the land of Moab, and came by the east side of the land of Moab,
    and pitched on the other side of Arnon, but came not within the border of Moab:
    for Arnon [was] the border of Moab. And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king
    of the Amorites, the king of Heshbon; and Israel said unto him, Let us pass, we
    pray thee, through thy land into my place. But Sihon trusted not Israel to pass
    through his coast: but Sihon gathered all his people together, and pitched in
    Jahaz, and fought against Israel. And the LORD God of Israel delivered Sihon and
    all his people into the hand of Israel, and they smote them: so Israel possessed
    all the land of the Amorites, the inhabitants of that country. And they possessed
    all the coasts of the Amorites, from Arnon even unto Jabbok, and from the wilderness
    even unto Jordan. So now the LORD God of Israel hath dispossessed the Amorites
    from before his people Israel, and shouldest thou possess it? Wilt not thou possess
    that which Chemosh thy god giveth thee to possess? So whomsoever the LORD our
    God shall drive out from before us, them will we possess.'
- source_sentence: What did the Jews ask Jesus if he was the Christ?
  sentences:
  - Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take
    it again. No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power
    to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received
    of my Father. There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these sayings.
    And many of them said, He hath a devil, and is mad; why hear ye him? Others said,
    These are not the words of him that hath a devil. Can a devil open the eyes of
    the blind? And it was at Jerusalem the feast of the dedication, and it was winter.
    And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon’s porch. Then came the Jews round about
    him, and said unto him, How long dost thou make us to doubt? If thou be the Christ,
    tell us plainly.
  - 'Now it came to pass after this, that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon
    died, and his son reigned in his stead. And David said, I will shew kindness unto
    Hanun the son of Nahash, because his father shewed kindness to me. And David sent
    messengers to comfort him concerning his father. So the servants of David came
    into the land of the children of Ammon to Hanun, to comfort him. But the princes
    of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, Thinkest thou that David doth honour thy
    father, that he hath sent comforters unto thee? are not his servants come unto
    thee for to search, and to overthrow, and to spy out the land? Wherefore Hanun
    took David’s servants, and shaved them, and cut off their garments in the midst
    hard by their buttocks, and sent them away. Then there went [certain], and told
    David how the men were served. And he sent to meet them: for the men were greatly
    ashamed. And the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your beards be grown, and [then]
    return. And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious
    to David, Hanun and the children of Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to
    hire them chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia, and out of Syriamaachah, and
    out of Zobah. So they hired thirty and two thousand chariots, and the king of
    Maachah and his people; who came and pitched before Medeba. And the children of
    Ammon gathered themselves together from their cities, and came to battle. And
    when David heard [of it], he sent Joab, and all the host of the mighty men.'
  - 'From whence [come] wars and fightings among you? [come they] not hence, [even]
    of your lusts that war in your members? Ye lust, and have not: ye kill, and desire
    to have, and cannot obtain: ye fight and war, yet ye have not, because ye ask
    not. Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume [it] upon
    your lusts. Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of
    the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world
    is the enemy of God. Do ye think that the scripture saith in vain, The spirit
    that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy? But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith,
    God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble. Submit yourselves therefore
    to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. Draw nigh to God, and he
    will draw nigh to you. Cleanse [your] hands, [ye] sinners; and purify [your] hearts,
    [ye] double minded.'
- source_sentence: What did Saul do when he was sore wounded by the archers?
  sentences:
  - Not because we have not power, but to make ourselves an ensample unto you to follow
    us. For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would not
    work, neither should he eat. For we hear that there are some which walk among
    you disorderly, working not at all, but are busybodies. Now them that are such
    we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus Christ, that with quietness they work,
    and eat their own bread. But ye, brethren, be not weary in well doing. And if
    any man obey not our word by this epistle, note that man, and have no company
    with him, that he may be ashamed. Yet count [him] not as an enemy, but admonish
    [him] as a brother. Now the Lord of peace himself give you peace always by all
    means. The Lord [be] with you all.
  - 'Now the Philistines fought against Israel: and the men of Israel fled from before
    the Philistines, and fell down slain in mount Gilboa. And the Philistines followed
    hard upon Saul and upon his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab,
    and Malchishua, Saul’s sons. And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers
    hit him; and he was sore wounded of the archers. Then said Saul unto his armourbearer,
    Draw thy sword, and thrust me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come
    and thrust me through, and abuse me. But his armourbearer would not; for he was
    sore afraid. Therefore Saul took a sword, and fell upon it. And when his armourbearer
    saw that Saul was dead, he fell likewise upon his sword, and died with him. So
    Saul died, and his three sons, and his armourbearer, and all his men, that same
    day together. And when the men of Israel that [were] on the other side of the
    valley, and [they] that [were] on the other side Jordan, saw that the men of Israel
    fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook the cities, and fled;
    and the Philistines came and dwelt in them. And it came to pass on the morrow,
    when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his three
    sons fallen in mount Gilboa.'
  - 'But in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty:
    from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in
    him. And when he polled his head, (for it was at every year’s end that he polled
    [it]: because [the hair] was heavy on him, therefore he polled it:) he weighed
    the hair of his head at two hundred shekels after the king’s weight. And unto
    Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter, whose name [was] Tamar:
    she was a woman of a fair countenance. So Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem,
    and saw not the king’s face. Therefore Absalom sent for Joab, to have sent him
    to the king; but he would not come to him: and when he sent again the second time,
    he would not come. Therefore he said unto his servants, See, Joab’s field is near
    mine, and he hath barley there; go and set it on fire. And Absalom’s servants
    set the field on fire. Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom unto [his] house,
    and said unto him, Wherefore have thy servants set my field on fire? And Absalom
    answered Joab, Behold, I sent unto thee, saying, Come hither, that I may send
    thee to the king, to say, Wherefore am I come from Geshur? [it had been] good
    for me [to have been] there still: now therefore let me see the king’s face; and
    if there be [any] iniquity in me, let him kill me.'

  | <code>What will happen to the daughter of the Chaldeans according to the passage?</code> | <code>Come down, and sit in the dust, O virgin daughter of Babylon, sit on the ground: [there is] no throne, O daughter of the Chaldeans: for thou shalt no more be called tender and delicate. Take the millstones, and grind meal: uncover thy locks, make bare the leg, uncover the thigh, pass over the rivers. Thy nakedness shall be uncovered, yea, thy shame shall be seen: I will take vengeance, and I will not meet [thee as] a man. [As for] our redeemer, the LORD of hosts [is] his name, the Holy One of Israel. Sit thou silent, and get thee into darkness, O daughter of the Chaldeans: for thou shalt no more be called, The lady of kingdoms. I was wroth with my people, I have polluted mine inheritance, and given them into thine hand: thou didst shew them no mercy; upon the ancient hast thou very heavily laid thy yoke. And thou saidst, I shall be a lady for ever: [so] that thou didst not lay these [things] to thy heart, neither didst remember the latter end of it. Therefore hear now this, [thou that ...</code> |
  | <code>Who is described as the shield of thy help and the sword of thy excellency?</code> | <code>Thy shoes [shall be] iron and brass; and as thy days, [so shall] thy strength [be]. [There is] none like unto the God of Jeshurun, [who] rideth upon the heaven in thy help, and in his excellency on the sky. The eternal God [is thy] refuge, and underneath [are] the everlasting arms: and he shall thrust out the enemy from before thee; and shall say, Destroy [them]. Israel then shall dwell in safety alone: the fountain of Jacob [shall be] upon a land of corn and wine; also his heavens shall drop down dew. Happy [art] thou, O Israel: who [is] like unto thee, O people saved by the LORD, the shield of thy help, and who [is] the sword of thy excellency! and thine enemies shall be found liars unto thee; and thou shalt tread upon their high places.</code>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
  | <code>What shall I come forth as after he hath tried me?</code>                          | <code>On the left hand, where he doth work, but I cannot behold [him]: he hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see [him]: But he knoweth the way that I take: [when] he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold. My foot hath held his steps, his way have I kept, and not declined. Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary [food]. But he [is] in one [mind], and who can turn him? and [what] his soul desireth, even [that] he doeth. For he performeth [the thing that is] appointed for me: and many such [things are] with him. Therefore am I troubled at his presence: when I consider, I am afraid of him. For God maketh my heart soft, and the Almighty troubleth me:</code>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
